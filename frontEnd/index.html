    <p>This project’s goal is to make a TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game) based on real-world animals where we can explore their natural abilities as well as make fun myths and legends about different species based on their names, where they are found, and their unique talents.</p>
    <div class="groupPicFlex"> <img class="basicPolorid rotateN20" src = "../images/pics/main/1frontpicpenguin.png" alt = "the emperor's penguins"/> <img class="basicPolorid rotate20" src = "../images/pics/main/2frontpicfox.png" alt = "the coat of the artic fox"/> <img class="basicPolorid rotateN10" src = "../images/pics/main/3frontpictwicestabbed.png" alt = "the wounds of the ladybug"/></div>

    <p>There are four main playable species within this world, Aves (bird-based species), Serpentes(snake-based species), Colptera (beetle-based species), and Vulpes (fox-based species). Each one of these species includes a variety of playable subspecies within it (Ex. Rock Dove, Emperor Penguin, and American robins are Aves subspecies) with their own skills and abilities based on the animal's real-life qualities and quirks.</p>
    <div class="groupPicFlex"> <img class="basicPolorid rotate10" src = "../images/pics/main/4frontpic.png" alt = "Aves Example"/> <img class="basicPolorid rotateN30" src = "../images/pics/main/5frontpic.png" alt = "Coleoptera Example"/> <img class="basicPolorid" src = "../images/pics/main/6frontpic.png" alt = "Serpentes Example"/> <img class="basicPolorid rotate20" src = "../images/pics/main/7frontpic.png" alt = "Vulpes Example"/></div>

    <img class="basicPolorid rightPic rotate20" src = "../images/pics/main/8frontpic.png" alt = "Firefly ready to attack"/>
    <p> Along with unique animal characters and fun legends, this TTRPG also has a combat system that promotes teamwork within your adventuring party. Every round, you are given incentives to help your team to defeat your foe rather than simply focusing on your own actions. There is little downtime when waiting for your turn as you and your allies are all constantly working as a party to help find the best and coolest ways to destroy your enemies. </p>

    <p> Speaking of enemies, there are many types of foes that you can find in the Animalia world, from corrupt leaders and bandits to the most common type of enemy, a variety of savage creatures hidden in the wilds. These creatures have strange attributes and physical characteristics that are combinations of different kinds of real-world animals. Not only do they have an odd genetic makeup, but they also are riddled with something known as Animalia particles. These particles contain the creature's special abilities.</p>

    <div class="groupPicFlex"> <img class="basicPolorid rotate20" src = "../images/pics/main/9frontpic.png" alt = "tiger beetle"/> <img class="basicPolorid rotateN20" src = "../images/pics/main/10frontpic.png" alt = "termite snake"/> <img class="basicPolorid" src = "../images/pics/main/11frontpic.png" alt = "penguin seal"/> </div>
    <img class="basicPolorid leftPic rotateN15" src = "../images/pics/main/12frontpic.png"/>
    <p> Special items can be found and crafted throughout your adventure that can harness these particles to make useful gear for navigating your next adventure. For example, if a creature has the ability to glow, then a cloak made out of its hide would also be able to glow. </p>

    <p> Navigating across these lands will require more than just teamwork and unique items. Your body will be tested alongside your quick wit and problem-solving skills. With the combined power of your head, arms and legs, there is little you can’t do. You will earn skill points for each one of these body parts, but it's up to you to decide what ones are more important to your character’s progression and assign those points accordingly. As you travel, you will also gain talents specific to your species and personal experience that will help you face the challenges that await you.</p>

    <p> There are many tales to tell, legends to explore, and adventures that await you in the world of Animalia. What stories will you write?</p>
